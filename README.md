# RedstoneFreedomMod
A server modification for the RedstoneFreedom server 
TotalFreedomMod is a CraftBukkit server plugin designed primarily to support the Official RedstoneFreedom Minecraft Server. However, you are more than welcome to adapt the source for your own server.
This plugin was originally coded by RedstoneMC (OxLemonxO), with Jerom van der Sar (Boki123) becoming heavily involved
in its development some time later. It consists of over 85 custom coded commands and a large variety of distinguishable
features not included in any other plugin. The plugin has since its beginning grown immensely. Together, with the main RedstoneFreedom server, RedstoneFreedomMod has a long-standing reputation of effectiveness whilst maintaining a clear feeling of
openness towards the administrators and the players themselves.
